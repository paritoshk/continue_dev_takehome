## Implementation Details

### Nested Dependencies and Minimizing Downloads

I've implemented a solution that handles nested dependencies and minimizes downloads by using semantic versioning. The main changes are in the `src/commands/install/challenge.ts` file.

Key features:
1. Resolves nested dependencies recursively
2. Handles version conflicts by selecting the best version that satisfies the most requirements
3. Creates a flat structure similar to pnpm for efficient storage
4. Detects and warns about circular dependencies

To test the implementation:
1. Run `npm run test` to execute all tests, including the new ones for `constructInstallationPlan`
2. Run `npm run test:install` to test the full installation process

The main logic is in the `constructInstallationPlan` function, which:
1. Builds a dependency tree
2. Resolves version requirements
3. Creates an installation plan that includes nested dependencies when necessary

Future improvements could include:
- Implementing a lock file for reproducible builds
- Adding a global cache to avoid re-downloading packages
- Implementing parallel downloads for faster installation
To build: `npm run build`

To test: `npm run test`

To run the add command: `npm run test:add -- <package>`

To run the install command: `npm run test:install`
